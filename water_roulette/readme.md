# Water Roulette Raspberry Pi Game
This is a simple game I through together to uses some Sprinkler valves triggered by the GPIO Pins.  
It has a single input button used to navigate the menus. 

May need to install following packages on the raspberry Pi before python modules will install.

`sudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-dev portaudio19-dev python-dev espeak`
